    <h1> Bio </h1>

    <p> Use this online <a href="riverLog.html"> river log </a> to document the miles you've boated. If you're training to be a commercial raft guide, you are required to complete a number of miles, with a guide instructor,
        before you can become a commercial river guide in the State of Colorado. If you just like to ride the dragon's back, you can keep a record of the trips you've done. The River-Log is set up with the date, the river, 
        the put-in/take-out, the number of miles, and the company's name (if required). Soon I hope to incorperate interactive features so you can create new logs on the spot with a database to hold each log, easy to use interfaces,
        and maybe hook up with some outfitters to help with finding permits to rivers. </p>
